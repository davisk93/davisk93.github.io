<p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href = "https://www.ducks.ca/our-work/science/saskatchewan-endowed-chair/saskatchewan-student-researchers/">Weegman Lab</a> at University of Saskatchewan where I'm working on a project to evaluate the demography and movement ecology of Midcontinent lesser snow geese. I am using multiple data types to develop an integrated metapopulation model for five subpopulations of Midcontinent snow geese to estimate subpopulation-specific estimates of survival, productivity, population size, and movement rates among subpopulations, as well as the effects of environmental variation on these demographics. The results of this holistic modeling framework are expected to inform both subpopulation and metapopulation-level management decisions for this species, as well as provide insight into the effects of future environmental variation on population dynamics.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. in the <a href = "https://zipkinlab.org/">Zipkin Lab</a> at Michigan State University under the supervision of Elise Zipkin. My dissertation work focused on understanding the demographic and environmental drivers that shape avian populations and communities. Prior to my Ph.D. work, I received my M.S. in Fish and Wildlife Conservation from <a href = "https://www.vtshorebirds.org/">Virginia Tech</a> where I studied seabird behavior and demography. I am broadly interested in using novel statistical methods to understand how global change is expected to affect the distributions and demography of bird populations and communities.</p>
