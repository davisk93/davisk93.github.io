<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href = "https://msu.edu/user/ezipkin/">Zipkin Lab</a> at Michigan State University. My dissertation work is focused on assessing seabird distributions as part of the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species [<a href = "https://www.boem.gov/GOMMAPPS/">GoMMAPPS</a>]. I collaborate with partners at USFWS and USGS to develop study design approaches for at-sea aerial surveys and models to estimate the factors influencing seabird distributions and abundance. Prior to my Ph.D. work, I received my M.S. in Fish and Wildlife Conservation from <a href = "https://www.vtshorebirds.org/">Virginia Tech</a> where I studied seabird behavior and demography. I am broadly interested in understanding how global change is expected to affect the distributions and population dynamics of different species using birds as a focal study system.</p>
