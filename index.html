I am a Ph.D. student in the [Zipkin Lab](https://msu.edu/user/ezipkin/) at Michigan State University. My dissertation work is focused on assessing seabird distributions as part of the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species ([GoMMAPPS](https://www.boem.gov/GOMMAPPS/)). I collaborate with partners at USFWS and USGS to develope study design approaches for at-sea aerial surveys and models to estimate the factors influencing seabird spatial patterns. I received my M.S. in Fish and Wildlife Conservation from Virginia Tech where I studied seabird behavior and demography.
